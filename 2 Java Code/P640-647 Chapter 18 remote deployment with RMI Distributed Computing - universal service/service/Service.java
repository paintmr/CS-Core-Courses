// A plain old (i.e. non-remote) interface, that defines the one method that any universal service must have—getGuiPanel(). The interface extends Serializable, so that any class implementing the Service interface will automatically be Serializable. 
// That’s a must, because the services get shipped over the wire from the server, as a result of the client calling getService() on the remote ServiceServer.
