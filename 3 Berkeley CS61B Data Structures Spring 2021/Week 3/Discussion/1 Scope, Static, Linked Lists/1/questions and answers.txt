Question (b)
On line 28, we set level equal to 50. What level do we mean? An instance variable of the
Pokemon object? The local variable containing the parameter to the change method? The local
variable in the main method? Something else?

Answer
It is the local variable in the change method and does not have any effect on the other variables
of the same name in the Pokemon class or the main method.
